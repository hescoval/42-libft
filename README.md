# 42-libft
My first project at 42 Porto, making my own library with set functions to help me throughout future projects.

## The NORMINETTE
All the code you will see in 42 repositories will be written according to the schools formatting norm, also called the Norminette.

- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, comments included
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function
